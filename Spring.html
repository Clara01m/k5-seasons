        <h2>If ever there were a spring day so perfect,
            so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze
            
            that it made you want to throw
            open all the windows in the house
            
            and unlatch the door to the canary's cage,
            indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,
            
            a day when the cool brick paths
            and the garden bursting with peonies
            
            seemed so etched in sunlight
            that you felt like taking
            
            a hammer to the glass paperweight
            on the living room end table,
            
            releasing the inhabitants
            from their snow-covered cottage
            
            so they could walk out,
            holding hands and squinting
            
            into this larger dome of blue and white,
            well, today is just that kind of day.</h2>
