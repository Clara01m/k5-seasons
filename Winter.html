      <h2>Crisply the bright snow whispered,
        Crunching beneath our feet;
        Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
        Our shadows danced,
        Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
        Across the lake the skaters
        Flew to and fro,
        With sharp turns weaving
        A frail invisible net.
        In ecstasy the earth
        Drank the silver sunlight;
        In ecstasy the skaters
        Drank the wine of speed;
        In ecstasy we laughed
        Drinking the wine of love.
        Had not the music of our joy
        Sounded its highest note?
        But no,
        For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
        “Oh look!”
        There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
        Fearless and gay as our love,
        A bluejay cocked his crest!
        Oh who can tell the range of joy
        Or set the bounds of beauty?</h2>
