        <h2>I love the fitfull gusts that shakes
             The casement all the day
            And from the mossy elm tree takes
             The faded leaf away
            Twirling it by the window-pane
            With thousand others down the lane
            
             
            I love to see the shaking twig
             Dance till the shut of eve
            The sparrow on the cottage rig
             Whose chirp would make believe
            That spring was just now flirting by
            In summers lap with flowers to lie
            
            I love to see the cottage smoke
             Curl upwards through the naked trees
            The pigeons nestled round the coat
             On dull November days like these
            The cock upon the dung-hill crowing
            The mill sails on the heath a-going
            
            The feather from the ravens breast
             Falls on the stubble lea
            The acorns near the old crows nest
             Fall pattering down the tree
            The grunting pigs that wait for all
            Scramble and hurry where they fall</h2>
